macdotfiles
===========

Dot files in my standard shell

*    `bash_profile` - unlike most *nix style systems on a mac it is the `.bash_profile` that is picked up first. This file simply calls the '.bashrc'
*    `bashrc` - simple '.bashrc' script which sets up the prompte, ssh and aliases
*    `public_alias` - I have private aliases for my shell which I'm not going to push to github, if you have some of these put them in a file `~/.alias`

I have added `setup.sh` which simply symlinks things in my home directory to where ever this git repo is cloned too...
